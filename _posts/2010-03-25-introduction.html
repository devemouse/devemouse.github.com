<p>I was wondering for a while what should I write here. I was thinking about the design and stuff... But finally I just realized that I should start writing and customization comes later.</p>
<h3>About me</h3>
<p>In my personal life I have my wonderful fiancee Basia :) I wonder how she will react about saying about her on my blog. We are getting married mid next year. Currently we are reworking our future home totally. We are almost ready but still much has to be done.</p>
<p>From technical point of view I am a software engineer, a geek, vim lover, and automation fan and user of GTDÂ® system. I hate doing stuff twice. If I know that I will have to do a thing more than once, I will rather write a script that will do thet work for me. I will post some of my scripts in the future.</p>
<h3>Why blog?</h3>
<p>Because so ;) When I used Emacs (yes I did) I encountered a blogger. She had few good ideas of customising Emacs. She was also writing book about emacs when I was interested in Emacs. I no longer use that editor but i kept her blog in my reader. Her posts inspirated me to do something like this for myself.</p>
<p>Another thing is that I often have some thoughts that I wish to share but not always I find th eaudience of my thoughts. The blog shall help me organising ans sharing my ideas. It would be also a good place to get other's opinions.</p>
<p>I also want to increase my writing skills. I want to get rid of school-like writing style.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Ok, that's it for now. Later posts will be better (I hope). Any comments are welcomed. I'm not afraid of criticism to my posts so write them please ;).</p>
<p>See ya'!</p>
